### Examples:
* structure optimization with on-the-fly ML (python API, serial): `structure-optimization-serial`
* on-the-fly MLMD (python API, parallel): `active/`
* command-line usage coupled with VASP: `VASP-command-line/`
* command-line usage coupled with GAUSSIAN: `GAUSSIAN-command-line/`

`structure-optimization-serial` is a good first example for getting started.

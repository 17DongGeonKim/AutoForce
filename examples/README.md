### Examples:
* Structure optimization with on-the-fly ML (python API): `structure-optimization-serial`
* Structure optimization with MPI parallelism (python API): `structure-optimization-parallel`
* On-the-fly MLMD (python API, parallel): `active/`
* Command-line usage coupled with VASP: `VASP-command-line/`
* Command-line usage coupled with GAUSSIAN: `GAUSSIAN-command-line/`
* Water-dimer relaxation: `GAUSSIAN-relax_water-dimer/`

In all of the above examples `run.sh` can be used for execution.
`structure-optimization-serial` is a good first example for getting started.

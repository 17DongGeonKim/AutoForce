### Nudged-Elastic-Band with on-the-fly ML

This example is copied and modified from:
<https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/tutorials/neb/diffusion.html>.

`gen_images.py` generates `images.traj` for starting NEB.
The commands for running are available in `run.sh`.
The optimized band is written to `neb.traj`.
`visualize.py` generated the barrier figure.
